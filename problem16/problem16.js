/**
 Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 */

let nums=[3,0,1]
let total=nums.length
for(let i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
    total=total+i-nums[i]

}
console.log("Final output",total);
